By the outbreak of First World War the allies in Europe were using armour-plated, open-topped vehicles with machine guns or other light guns or artillery pieces. The most popular British car was the Napier that was first produced in 1912. The design consisted of a number of alternative bodies which enabled the chassis to be adapted quickly for different roles 

Armoured cars were used on the Western Front but they were limited in trench warfare because they could not handle very uneven terrain. The British army used armoured cars with great success in Palestine and in Mesopotamia where they were deployed in what had previously been the Cavalry role of outflanking and pursuit.

The bolt is the device that closes the breech of the barrel. The bolt-action rifle had a metal box, into which cartridges were placed on top of a spring. As the bolt was opened, the spring forced the cartridges up against a stop; the bolt pushed the top cartridge into the chamber as it closed. After firing, the opening of the bolt extracted the empty cartridge case, and the return stroke loaded a fresh round.

            >&quot;Combat, or fighting, is a purposeful violent conflict meant to establish dominance over the opposition. Combat may take place under a certain set of rules or be unregulated. Examples of rules include the Geneva Conventions (covering the treatment of soldiers in war), medieval Chivalry,etc..

Combat in warfare involves two or more opposing military organizations, usually fighting for nations at war (although guerrilla warfare and suppression of insurgencies can fall outside this definition). Warfare falls under the laws of war, which govern its purposes and conduct, and protect the rights of soldiers and non-combatants.

We classify combat operations according to two orthogonal, non-exclusding criteria: 

1) Military operations can be classified by the scale and scope of force employment, and their impact on the wider conflict.

2) Military operations can be classified by the generic active or passive role forces have at the beginning of a conflict

            >In the early 1900s the British Army began considering the ways that motor transport could be used during a large-scale war. It was recognised that motor transport would enable the British Army to move troops very quickly. In 1911 the British Army announced its strategy for acquiring motor transport in an emergency. An annual fee of &#163;15 was to be paid for each lorry registered with the British Army. By 1914 this fee had been increased to &#163;110. 

When war was declared in August 1914 a total of 1,200 lorries were acquired by the Army. One of the most successful lorries used by the British Army was the Dennis 3-Ton Lorry. The four-cylinder engine enabled the lorry to reach 55 mph. Even when loaded, it could climb gradients as steep as 1 in 6. Over 7,000 Dennis 3-Ton lorries were built and used during the First World War.

The United States Army purchased these guns in 1865 and over the next few years most major armies in Europe obtained this gun. 

The success of Gatling&#39;s automatic gun encouraged others to enter the market. In 1879 the Gardner Machine Gun was demonstrated for the first time. A two-barrelled weapon operated by crank which loaded and fired each barrel in turn. The feed system was a grooved strip into which the rims of a box of cartridges could be slid, after which the box was removed. In public trials the gun fired 10,000 rounds in 27 minutes. This impressed military leaders from Britain and the following year the British Army purchased the gun.

&quot;Pillboxes or blockhouses were miniature forts developed by the German army to give their trench lines extra strength. The term pillbox was used by the British soldiers because the reinforced concrete construction was the same shape as the boxes in which chemists supplied tablets during the war. Pillboxes generally measured 30 ft. along the front and were about 10 ft. wide. 

German machine-gunners were often housed inside pillboxes. With very thick walls, they were difficult to destroy by artillery barrages. It was possible to fire through narrow slits in the wall, however, during an enemy offensive, the machine-guns were placed either on the top, or at the side of the pillbox. 

The British built very few machine-gun pillboxes. The official reason for not building them was that &quot;such works were not worth the labour or the cost&quot;. Probably the real reason was that the High Command feared that if the troops had such solid defences they would be less offensively-minded. 

Both sides also used smaller machine-gun posts. The British tended to use Bergmann machine-gun rather than Maxims in these posts. Germans built machine-gun posts in large numbers all along the line at Ypres and Messines&quot;</rdfs:comment>

The Maxim Gun was adopted by the British Army in 1889. It was first used by Britain`s colonial forces in the Matabele war in 1893-94. In one engagement, fifty police of the Rhodesian character company fought off 5,000 Matabele warriors with just four Maxim guns. The design was taken over by the Vickers Company and was used by the army for over seventy years.

The Maxim Gun could fire 400-600 rounds of small-calibre ammunition per minute. Each gun had the firepower of about 100 rifles.

In August 1914, Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, asked the London General Omnibus Company to provide buses for the use of moving troops in France. The company asked for volunteers from among their conductors and drivers and eventually 75 crews were chosen and then recruited into the Royal Marines. In September 1914, 75 Diamler buses and crews were shipped to France. Some of the buses were captured by the Germans but the rest remained in France until the end of the war in November, 1918.

Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons.

            >In 1912 the British Army adopted the Vickers as its standard machine gun. Produced by the Vickers Company, it was a modified version of the Maxim Machine-Gun. The Vickers Gun used a 250 round fabric-belt magazine and had the reputation as a highly reliable weapon. 

The .303 Vickers Gun could fire over 600 rounds per minute and had a range of 4,500 yards. Being water-cooled, it could fire continuously for long periods. There were usually six men in a Vickers gun team. In his book, With a Machine Gun to Cambrai, George Coppard, explained how the Vickers Gun Team worked. &quot;Number One was leader and fired the gun, while Number Two controlled the entry of ammo belts into the feed-block. Number Three maintained a supply of ammo to Number Two, and Number Four to Six were reserves and carriers, but all the members of the team were fully trained in handling the gun.&quot;

This is a first attempt for a list of weapons relevant to SAILS..... 
It seems possible to classify weapons in three ways:
1) by user: what person or unit uses the weapon
2) by function: the construction of the weapon and principle of operation
3) by target: the type of target the weapon is designed to attack</rdfs:comment>
